# GSS_Statistical_Analysis
For this project, I used ggplot2 and hypothesis tests to analyze GSS(General Social Survey) and BRFSS2013 data thoroughly to get insights about health situation and education level.

The language I used is R. ggplot2 is used for drawing visualized summary, hypothesis test is used for statistical inference.
